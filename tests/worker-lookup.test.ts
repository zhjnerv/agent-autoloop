// reports a run that is still going as finished because the failed lookup was read as "the process is gone"; or, unable
// to look, it holds a stuck or stopped run forever because its timeout and its stop wait on a sighting that never comes;
// or it holds back the result of a run that has ended, stopping a process group it can't see anything left in; or, unable
// to see a group it stopped itself because the turn was over, it throws away the answer the turn gave and the hub runs
// the work again. Or, waiting on a slow lookup (PowerShell takes over a second to start on Windows), it holds up the
// hub that shares its process, so the state, the stream and answers to cards stall while any run is going.
