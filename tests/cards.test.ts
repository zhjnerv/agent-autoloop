// What reaches the owner. A card's words never change; only its state does. Failure cases: asking the same thing while it
// is open makes a second card, or closed it blocks asking again; an answer takes a choice that doesn't exist, carries
// more words or a longer reference than the protocol allows, counts twice,
// or beats a resolve that came first (only one may change an open card); an answer from someone not on the channel's list,
// or on a message that isn't the one sent, counts; an answer doesn't wake the thread that asked, wakes another thread, is
// lost because its run was merged, or doesn't carry the session, the rule's session title and what the asker left for
// itself; the card doesn't show
// what was done once its run finishes; a run resolves a card outside what it was given to check, or a bad id spoils its own
// result; resolving wakes nobody. Delivery: a channel gets a card it has, gets none it should, loses a report and sends a second
// message (the ref sticks, and a stale report doesn't undo a newer one); a stale failure delays a newer version; a failed
// send retries at once, or for ever; a channel that never came counts as having failed; a card solved before it was sent
// bothers the owner; two channels don't each get their own copy; an answer in one channel doesn't update the other.
// Words on an answer or a notice that aren't text crash instead of being refused; an answer to a card whose rule has gone
// crashes or starts something; closing or reporting a failure on a card that isn't there, or wasn't handed over, crashes.
// A stopped run's receipt takes effect, or the answer it carried shows as carried out. A failed run merged with what came
// in meanwhile loses the session of the answer in it, or has it wiped by what had none. A run with events from two
// sources is given, or closes, cards that have no source. A channel that takes a card and never reports gets it for ever.
// A card closed while its first message is on the way never gets that message updated.
// A rule that lists its channels has its cards, and the notices of its runs, sent to others as well; one that lists none
// stops reaching every channel; a notice of nobody's rule reaches only some. With defaultChannels, a card that names no
// channels of its own (a tell, the hub's own alert, a task elsewhere asking, a rule without a list) still reaches every
// channel, so several channels each repeat it (issue #221); and a rule that lists its own is held to the default.
// Receipt FYIs must arrive closed without buttons, stay out of later open lists, and never wake work when clicked;
// ordinary notices, questions, quiet rules, and the one-day FYI delivery window must keep their existing behavior.
// The why timeline must show receipt FYIs without adding empty closures or repeating hub-generated end notices.
// The answers material carries the chosen text, or a 0-based choice gets read as the first option (issue #197: an Agent
// reported 绿色 as 蓝色).
