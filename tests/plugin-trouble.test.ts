// One process holds the hub, the worker and the channels, and plugins run inside it. Failure cases: an agent plugin that
// can't read what it printed ends the process, and ends it again on every start because the run is still there; a channel
// plugin that returns at once goes round without a pause and the hub never answers again, with the process alive so nothing
// restarts it; a channel plugin's stray throw or unhandled rejection ends the process; the database held too long by
// another process makes a tick throw from a timer and ends the process, the rules change that tick brought is lost, the retry
// is lost to whatever comes along before it, or rules written wrong in that time are never told; a worker that stops isn't
// started again; losing the place the log goes makes the error about it go round for ever, with the hub no longer answering.
